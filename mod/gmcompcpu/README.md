gmcompcpu
===========

Students procastinating too much? Are they playing games instead of studying? Well now you can motivate them by allowing them to do both at once!

gmcompcpu is an activity module that loads quiz questions from the course it's added to.
The possible answers come down as space ships and you have to shoot the correct one.
